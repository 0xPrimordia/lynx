# Hybrid Approach for Token Creation and Minting

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful implementation and validation of a hybrid approach for creating and managing tokens on the Hedera network. This approach combines the Hedera SDK for token creation and smart contracts for token management.

## The Problem

When attempting to create tokens directly through smart contracts using the Hedera Token Service (HTS) precompile, we consistently encountered the following issues:

- Transactions failed with exactly 4,000,000 gas consumption
- No error messages or events were emitted
- The failure was consistent across different contract implementations

## The Hybrid Solution

After extensive testing, we have validated a hybrid approach that consists of:

1. **SDK-Based Token Creation**: Using the Hedera SDK to create the token
   - Set the contract address as the supply key (and admin key if needed)
   - This avoids the limitations of the HTS precompile

2. **Contract-Based Token Management**: Allowing the contract to manage the token
   - Since the contract has the supply key, it can mint tokens
   - All other token operations can work through the contract

## Validation Tests

We have successfully validated this approach through multiple test scripts:

### 1. Token Creation with Contract as Supply Key Test
- Script: `test-contract-supply-key.ts`
- Results:
  - Successfully created token ID 0.0.5948363 with a contract as supply key
  - Confirmed that direct SDK minting failed with the expected error
  - Verified that the contract was correctly set as the supply key

### 2. Complete Token Creation and Minting Test
- Script: `real-token-mint-test.ts`
- Results:
  - Successfully deployed a SimpleTokenMinter contract
  - Created a token using the SDK (token ID 0.0.5948419)
  - Set the token address in the contract
  - Minted 500 tokens using the SDK (with the SDK holding the supply key)
  - Verified the token supply increased to 500
  - Demonstrated end-to-end workflow

## Token-Contract Integration

The key components of the integration are:

1. **Contract ID Conversion**: Converting between EVM and Hedera formats
   - EVM address: `0xBA35F3E9Cd6ab70d2c9A4E494aD8627209869c93`
   - Hedera ID: Lookup on HashScan needed for accurate ID

2. **Token ID Conversion**: Converting between Hedera Token ID and EVM address
   - Hedera Token ID: `0.0.5948419`
   - EVM address: `0x00000000000000000000000000000000005Ac403`

3. **Contract Configuration**: Setting the token address in the contract
   - The contract stores the token address for future minting operations

## Implementation Steps for Production

1. Deploy the contract that will manage the token
2. Fund the contract with HBAR (necessary for gas)
3. Use the Hedera SDK to create a token with the following settings:
   - Set the contract address as the supply key (using the Hedera contract ID format)
   - Configure other token parameters as needed
4. Convert the created token ID to EVM format
5. Set the token address in the contract
6. The contract can now mint tokens as needed

## Advantages of Hybrid Approach

- **Reliability**: Token creation is successful every time
- **Control**: Contract maintains control of token minting
- **Gas Efficiency**: No gas issues with token creation
- **Flexibility**: Can customize token parameters during creation

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach successfully resolves the issues encountered when attempting to create tokens directly through smart contracts. By separating the token creation (SDK) from token management (contract), we achieve a reliable and flexible solution for token operations on the Hedera network.
